# Advanced_Ds_project


The intent is to build a fault -tolerant, atomic and distributed key-value store. The system should detect and report node failures in a distributed system and handle client requests in reliable manner.

The request to GET and PUT by client needs to be satisfied and consistency and replication needs to be maintained at all stages. It is a two member project where.

I am responsible for simulation infrastructure for testing while my partner is responsible for system development and testing.
